# HeartRate Graph for the Microsoft Band and Windows Phone 8.1+
Just playing with the MS Band API. I got the app to graph my heart rate, and export the heart rate to a CSV. This project is horribly under construction and there are zero UX considerations so the UI and UX is really bad. Improvements are in the works.

# TO-DO
- Finish styling graph
- Add hover activities on graph (view individual data points)
- Error handling (crashes if no band is connected currently)
- Possible zoom into graph
- Add a title, logo, splash screen and other fine polishes
- Fix the initial timing issue where it records a few seconds of the same rate because the band is "acquiring heart rate"

#Possible Features
- Power BI implementation/live feed to PBI?
- Upgrade from a WP8.1 app to a Windows 10 Universal app, and enable desktop compatibility
- Export to a .xlsx file
